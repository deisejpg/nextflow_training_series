# Nextflow Training Series

I started learning Nextflow recently to develop the NGS part of a data product I am working on.  I am absolutely amazed by this tool! I remember writing similar (of course not as good!) workflows using bash and python scripts, launch for batch processing, sleep && and nohup. The logic of the workflow is pretty similar to the logic of developing a workflow from scratch in a different programming language, so it is smooth to follow.

I am currently using nextflow to analyse OPA (Oncomine Precision Assay Data for Genexus by Thermo Fisher) data to confirm variant calls and look for additional calls that were not included in previous versions of the variant calling software (Ion Reporter).

This repo has files I am going through while following the series at:  
https://training.nextflow.io/hello_nextflow

It is not supposed to replicate the running env so I didn't add some necessary folders. It is just to have the files somewhere for quick reference.
